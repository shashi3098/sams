<br>First Meeting</br>
<p style ="color:red">The first time I have met a girl. some of my friends are playing pool and this girl has bought some sweet (bread halwa) for my friend I took the box from my friend hand and try to eat the sweet but I cannot then what I did was I ate all the nut in the sweet and left the sweet for my friend. This was the first time I saw her. Then after some days all my roomies stared talking and chatting with girls but I was a person like who used to be like I don’t care what they do but what happened was slowly they stared brining food for us and used to have some chat. One day I came late from my job and was lying in the bed then there come these girls into my apartment they started chatting with my friends I was lying there in the bed room because I worked almost from morning to evening and next day I have leave to job early in the morning, but they started laughing and shouting I cannot even sleep so I came stood and closed the door of my bed room even though I cannot sleep then I put some songs and hardly closed my eyes but could not sleep just because of their sounds so then I thought y should I be inside the bed room .Then I came out and some of my friend introduced me with them. Their I came to know few girls. Then the next day they made us some kind of biryani but it was like kichadi in my hostel but that was good.</p>
<p>I am like a sports guy so, after few days I was playing table tennis she was passing by she was distributing some chocolates to my friends as she know them well than me. She gave me a chocolate and the funny thing is that it was a Prasad (hahhahah). Then after few days I was playing pool then she come there with her friends and we had some chat with all their friends including her they  used to laugh because of my language, finally that made us to talk I think so. Then she tried to ask my mobile number but I tried to refuse her because of my shyness because I am like a typical Indian guy. Then immediate next day I was back from my job and there is nothing to eat in my room and my lazy mind now thought about calling her and try for some food and then I introduced  myself and asked about the food finally she bought the food. Now we became friends and I saw her in my one of the class. Usually I go to class directly from my work because I used to travel by bus I would never have time to go room and change my dress to class I was late to the class that day and I want to listen to the lecture so I sat in the third row where she was next to me. I was listening to the class I was getting sleep so what I did was just took some gums from my bag which made some crackling sound and she was laughing at me so I asked her whether she want some but she said no. slowly our friendship became stronger and then I used to go to her single room where she used to live and eat some food with my friends. Then we used to call text and chat every day.</p>

<p style ="color:yellow">AFTER SOME DAYS
 In this way we became close and our friends would tease us I never cared about that. In a same way I told her all this is happening just because of her, and I was just joking like my friends then she left the pool room and she never text me and called  me back . initially, I  thought that she was busy but  then later when she  came across to me at the pool room and the table tennis the place where I usually hangout most of the time, she behaved as if she never know me. That hurt me a lot. And was thinking about her just because I just don’t know what was wrong with me or her so I called her she did not respond I texted her she did not respond because she don’t want me to get in trouble but she never knew that she is troubling me by doing this way then somehow I got in touch with her after few days and just asked one thing that “did I do any mistake” and the response says no so I asked her, then why are u doing this to me. After a few conversation she came to realize that I was joking on that day at the pool room and then she became normal but then I decided not to talk to her and deleted her number. After few days I was doing my assignment and she asked me whether she can help me out but I said no to her then she left from there. After this incident for some long days I never copied her number into my mobile. Then after all this is happened now we started talking normally and became some good friends.
<p style ="color:blue">After few days, as we had a same class there was a exam and that day there was a festival and she wore a purple color dress in which she was looking beautiful, stunning and by the way that is a traditional dress. Some of my friends told me not to rome with her but I never cared because I am always what I am. So I used to be with her and be as good friend. After few days the class was done I went to trip (India).

Back in India<br>
<p style ="color:green">I was enjoying with my family after one long year and I miss them a lot. And one day my phone was beeping there was a text from her I have told her my Indian number and she used call me and text me at my number. She used to share everything with me. Then my trip to India was finished came back to Kent (u.s.a). We meet, we chat, we talked….and then we had long walks …….</p>

<p>Memorable days<br>

<p style ="color:green">There comes the first festival after my return from back India. This is one of the favorite festivals I enjoy a lot which is  nothing but Ganesh Chaturthi. She has invited me to her room as she was doing Pooja and preparing some sweet and everything. Even though I love to go their but as I had a job on that day I could not go there in the morning but finally I went there after my job. I was flat by the decoration made by her on that day. Then i ate some five verities of food which I usually do only when I am in India or  at my sweet home.
Now, after all these days we became close friends and she used to share everything with me and I used to tell her everything. We used to go for long walk at night times for long time and used to spend lot of time at a lake near my university. Initially she used to talk a lot but after, days passed the characters have changed I used to talk and she stared listening. After a few days, that was the first time I took her out alone and we had an ice cream at MacDonald’s we almost spent like three to four hours eating one single ice cream. Its 12:00am in the night so some of my friends trying to call me to have some food so at last we started to move from there around 12:30am. i used to enjoy long walks at night time with her. After all this, she once asked my date of birth but I have told her a wrong date but finally the day has come, it is October  sixteen the day before my birthday. one of my friends knew my birthday so they were planning to do some event . That was the day I had no job and stayed back in the room so as my friends want to make some arrangements they have called her and asked her to get me out of my room .now I have  got a call from her saying that she wants to meet me very urgent so I went to their room I find nothing interesting except the biryani so I ate some biryani then  I wanted to leave, now  she asked me to take her to Walmart so that she could waste some time there and could  get back around 12:00am.but I don’t have  my car keys. so I went to my room to get the keys and found some arrangements doing by my friends.  So I silently went into room and took the cars keys and left the room and came back around 12:00am and now here is my birthday and she is the first person to great me on this twenty fifth birthday. She just texted me. I was asking her about visiting a temple on my birthday before I said it was my birthday so now finally, the very next day I went to temple with some other friends along with her. We enjoyed a lot on that day we visited a place where there was a dandiya dance going on as that was the time of dussara so I was enjoying looking at that. She used to cry every night that day I finally saw her very happy after many days and thought she should always be the same way but god is crazy he never want that. After the dance program we went to have dinner and came back home late night. After a week i.e on October twenty seventh, we once again want to go out so we have selected a place called Cuyahoga falls but unexpectedly we have visited a place called Cuyahoga valley park where we just found a long walking path as that was a spring season the color of the trees changed to different color so everyone loved that place after walking a long way we stared to take pictures which were very beautiful as there was a sun set and the change in the color of the leaves. One of the beautiful scenes that I can never forget the place nor the girl. I have got a few clicks which I can never lose them in my life time. As we became this close we used to go for night rides and eat something.  Now after a month it is on November nineteenth, there was a Halloween party at our university library she was asking me to come and I was working whole day so I don’t want to go but I could not refuse because she asked to spend some time, so went there as she asked me. She has worn a nice white dress which was above her knees. Usually I don’t like that kind of dressing style but that day I had not even said a single word. This was the second time I saw her being very much happy playing with all her friends. I feel like I can do any this for her happiness. So the immediate next day there was a Halloween party in the downtown people dress up like ghost, vampire etc.….. People drink dance and enjoy on that day so just have warned her many time not to go into pubs because people drink and miss behave with u. and there was a rain on that day so Halloween was not as good as last year. she has asked me to come with her but I refused her offer because of my friends even though I wanted to go with her. But finally I have meet her in the streets with her friends and I am with my friends and she has left home little early. I have arrived home around at 2:30 am In the morning picking some of my friends from downtown after all this happen I was about to sleep/ then there was a text saying that “shall we go out”. initially I said no later I woke up even though I was were lazy but finally went with them for just a casual long ride and came back around 4:00 am In the morning. After a few days I was doing my job and that was the day I was very much hungry and we I wanted to go out. I never like to eat alone so I have asked her to come out with me and we went for a long ride to some place where I have never visited to have some dinner I hop is the name of the place and she was trying to ask me something from the start of the drive. That was one of the special day in my life. The one thing that happened for the first time for both of us. Finally reached home around 3:00am. After few days there was a trip for me I was going to Niagara falls and some of my friends also joined me and she was also with us but I could not talk to her and be as casual on that  trip a boring but something special in that trip. This trip has thought me something “if people like you, then you can even enjoy the boring time” that’s something special. We just had one or two clicks in the entire trip but I love them. after few days some of my friends planned to go to New York and New jersey and this girl joined us once again this time I think I had enjoyed a bit but finally while returning back from New York I had drove the car for almost some three to four hours which I have enjoyed a lot and she is sitting next to me that is too good. That was one of the best rides. Then we got habited to go for long drives in midnight and come back in late nights but I enjoyed each and every ride of that. There was a special day called Kartika Purnima and she love moon so I have decide to take her out and have a moon light dinner in an open area so took her to a place at my university stadium where there are very less cars in the parking lot and showed her the moon and I think she enjoyed it. But I have enjoyed that ride as I have got some nice delicious food on that day. Finally on the day of November eleventh around 11:30 I have pXXXXXXXXXXXX her looking at her eyes. A special movement in my life and she was shock even though she was expecting the same from me. I have no idea why I have said those word but I know that i feel like saying that. The next day we went to shopping for some small kid that was a memory for me because whenever some lovers enter the store I used to crack some jokes looking at them but now this is the time I am doing the same here so this is something special.</p>
<p style ="color:blue">Till now all these incidents may be special or not but one best thing happened on 12/12/15. The best think happened in my life thank you for what ever happened till now. All the credit goes to her. 
12/15/15 I think this may be one last ride with her and finally wanted to say that I always wanted her to be happy where ever she may be. But now she is leaving the university on 12/18/15 to some other place.  Hope you both can be a good couple. You are something special I feel like I am missing some one now whom I should not. “Hope she has got a person who love her the best but I have lost a person who love me the best. “</p>
 <p style ="color:orange" >But this time I have no idea where I may go and where she may go. But finally a small hope that we both can at least talk and be as some good friends for the remaining life time hoping the best to happen  with love…………..
Finally may be the last or may be the first saying this……
